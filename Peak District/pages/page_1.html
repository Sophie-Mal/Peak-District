        <h2>About the Peak District:</h2>
        <div class="text">
        <p>
            The Peak District, established as the first national park in the UK in 1951, is a region of diverse landscapes located in central and northern England. 
            <br>
            It spans parts of Derbyshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, and Yorkshire. 
            <br>
            Historically, the area is known for its ancient settlements and industrial heritage, including the remains of Roman roads and lead mining sites. 
            <br>
            Geographically, the Peak District is divided into the northern Dark Peak, characterized by rugged moorlands and gritstone edges, and the southern White Peak, noted for its rolling limestone dales and picturesque villages.

        <h4>Top 5 most interesting facts:</h4>
        <div class="text">
        <ol>
            <li>First National Park: The Peak District was the first area to be designated as a national park in the
                United Kingdom, established on April 17, 1951.</li>
            <li>Diverse Geological Features: The park is divided into two contrasting regions: the Dark Peak, known for
                its gritstone edges and moorlands, and the White Peak, distinguished by its limestone dales and rolling
                pastures.</li>
            <li>Historical Sites: The Peak District is home to numerous historical landmarks, including the ancient
                stone circle of Arbor Low, the impressive Chatsworth House, and Peveril Castle, a Norman fortification
                overlooking Castleton.</li>
            <li>Caving and Pot Holing: The region is famous for its extensive cave systems, particularly around
                Castleton, with notable caves like Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern, and Peak Cavern, which attract
                spelunkers and tourists alike.</li>
            <li>Kinder Scout Mass Trespass: In 1932, the Kinder Scout Mass Trespass took place, where hundreds of
                ramblers protested against the lack of public access to open country. This event played a pivotal role
                in the movement for public right of way and access to the countryside, eventually leading to the
                establishment of national parks in the UK.</li>
