        <h2>About the Peak District:</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                The Peak District, established as the first national park in the UK in 1951, is a region of diverse
                landscapes located in central and northern England.
                <br>
                It spans parts of Derbyshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, and Yorkshire.
                <br>
                Historically, the area is known for its ancient settlements and industrial heritage, including the
                remains of Roman roads and lead mining sites.
                <br>
                Geographically, the Peak District is divided into the northern Dark Peak, characterized by rugged
                moorlands and gritstone edges, and the southern White Peak, noted for its rolling limestone dales and
                picturesque villages.
