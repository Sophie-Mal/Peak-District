Device Testing Throughout:

During the process of making my website I used a range of different devices to test the responsiveness of the website. 
I found issues with the website being used on phones, where the top nav bar and the footer wouldn’t stretch to either side of the page and was slightly squashed into the centre making it more difficult to read and use. The top nav bar also covered the title when viewed on phones as while it was squashed into the centre of the page, it was stretched down causing this to happen.
I fixed these issues with changes to the css making the nav bar stationary for use on phones, stretched out to the sides and the whole page to be moved down slightly, meaning the title was out of the way and couldn’t be covered by the nav bar.
The following list of devices are what I used to test my website while being built and afterwards to test any issues & changes:

* Pixel 6 pro 
* Pixel 8 pro
* iPhone 15 
* iPhone 12 
* Samsung galaxy 
* Samsung S22 Ultra 
* iPhone 13 
* iPad 
* MacBook Air  
* PC

Resources and Acknowledgements:
Below shows some of the resources used to create a user-friendly website, that is presented in the best way possible.

Design: 

The design of "Explore the Peak District" is user-friendly and visually appealing, focusing on ease of navigation and an engaging user experience. The layout is clean and organised, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need.

* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), [Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/)
* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/), [Megapixl](https://www.megapixl.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), [Simple Image Resizer](https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/).

Key Design Elements:

* Responsive Design: Optimised for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
* Navigation Menu: Clear and intuitive menu categorising information into Attractions, Activities, Accommodations, Travel Tips, and Events.
* Search Functionality: A powerful search bar allowing users to quickly locate specific information.
* Photo Galleries: High-quality images showcasing the beauty of the Peak District.

Navigation:

I chose to have a navigation bar at the top of the webpage as this allows easy navigation throughout the site. This helps most users find their way through the website as easily as possible.
On larger devices (tablets/ipads etc) the navigation bar moves over the page as you scroll, this is helpful as you can switch to another page at any point.
On smaller devices (phones etc) the navigation bar is stationary at the top of the page as you scroll, this is because there isn't as much space on the screen and this allows for more space to view images and read the information presented.

There is also a footer which contains a link to each page. This is stationary on every page, and just purely there for practical reasons, especially on phones where the navigation bar doesn't follow the page. This just shows the pages and contains my Copyright tag.

![Footer](images/footer.png)

When you hover over the titles of each section, it changes colour slightly and underlines to show it is a link. Each link takes you to an external page, either the wikipedia for more information, or a booking site for the accommodation etc.

The Current Layout Structure:

The current layout of the website is to have a title, then an image, showcasing the piece of information below.

Future Layout Structure Plans:

I would like to re-arrange the layout to have a title, then an image and place the information to the right of the image, then the one below the information would be to the left of the image. This will give the website more of a newpaper/magazine look and feel to it.

Website Building:
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/).

Validator scores: 

The HTML validator came back with the hr tag being out of place, however this is what is used to create a break between the webpage and the footer and there was no way of changing this so the HTML validator accepted it.

The CSS validator came back clear with no known issues.
