Device Testing Throughout:

During the process of making my website I used a range of different devices to test the responsiveness of the website. 
I found issues with the website being used on phones, where the top nav bar and the footer wouldn’t stretch to either side of the page and was slightly squashed into the centre making it more difficult to read and use. The top nav bar also covered the title when viewed on phones as while it was squashed into the centre of the page, it was stretched down causing this to happen.
I fixed these issues with changes to the css making the nav bar stationary for use on phones, stretched out to the sides and the whole page to be moved down slightly, meaning the title was out of the way and couldn’t be covered by the nav bar.
The following list of devices are what I used to test my website while being built and afterwards to test any issues & changes:

* Pixel 6 pro 
* Pixel 8 pro
* iPhone 15 
* iPhone 12 
* Samsung galaxy 
* Samsung S22 Ultra 
* iPhone 13 
* iPad 
* MacBook Air  
* PC
